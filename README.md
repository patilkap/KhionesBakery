# KhionesBakery
A unique app dedicated to a bakery which can be accessed by customers who would like order pastries, or administration who can log in using their password to access inventory, staff, etc.

## Inspiration
I love desserts and pastries! So I was thinking about how I can incorporate that with my project into something useful that can be used to make everyday business become more efficient and automated. That's when I thought of doing an attractive app that can make the small business owner's life easier by accessing their inventory and staff information just as easily as customers can order food.

## What it does
This app provides the basic information of the bakery, allows customers to browse and order pastries or desserts, and give access to admins for inventory and staff information.

## How I built it
I built it using Xcode/Swift while learning the language at the same time!

## Challenges I ran into
As I wanted to incorporate tabs into my app, there was a challenge that couldn't connect the tabs and ViewControllers to the corresponding swift file. After over an hour of trying and asking around, someone finally suggesting a solution that worked!

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of the design aspect and how easily the menu flows and keeps a minimalist theme. I am also proud for learning Swift and doing all this from knowing absolutely nothing. 

## What I learned
I learned how to use Swift, how there is a new SwiftUI method that recently came out, and how to work Xcode. I also learned how hectic hackathons can be and how small problems can be so stressful!

## What's next for Khione's Bakery
Next, the app will be extended to provide the inventory levels and create a deep learning network where the app will tell you what pastries you can make with the given ingredients in stock. This can be applied to different fields of businesses and truly can save a lot of time for people that need to calculate the same thing over and over again when a computer can automate it.
